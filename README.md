# DeviceInfo
DeviceInfo QR Code Generator
Simple app to Generate a QR Code from the Device Information.

Long Press the QR Code to see what was gathered.

I wanted this to be able to do Inventory on a device. Store this in a DB and upload to a WebServer to track said inventory.  Things I gathered are who it belonged to such as their Name, Email, Phone Number, SIM SN, Manufacturer, Model and Device SN.  These things should not never duplicate and then this info could be use to uniquie identify the user and the device.

You could also use this to Check Vistors in and out of your office/lobby, such as (https://devpost.com/software/check-in-n-out) https://github.com/Lianathanoj/Check-In-N-Out
