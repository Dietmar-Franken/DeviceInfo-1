DeviceInfo QR Code Generator
Simple app to Generate a QR Code from the Device Information.

Long Press the QR Code to see what was gathered.

I wanted this to be able to do Inventory on a device. Store this in a DB and upload to a WebServer to track said inventory.  Things I gathered are who it belonged to, thier Phone Number, SIM SN, Manufacturer, Model and SN.
